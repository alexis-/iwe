	/// Stores the result of a raycast operation.
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	/// A instance of this structure is passed to a Raycast object, and is filled in
	/// as the ray traverses the volume. The 'foundIntersection' field indicates whether
	/// the ray hit any solid voxels, and if so the 'intersectionVoxel' field indicates
	///the voxel's position
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	struct RaycastResult
	{
		///Indicates whether an intersection was found
		bool foundIntersection;
		///If an intersection was found then this field holds the intersecting voxel, otherwise it is undefined.
		Vector3DInt32 intersectionVoxel;
	};

	/// The Raycast class can be used to find the fist filled voxel along a given path.
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	/// The principle behind raycasting is to fire a 'ray' through the volume and determine
	/// what (if anything) that ray hits. This simple test can be used for the purpose of
	/// picking, visibility checks, lighting calculations, or numerous other applications.
	///
	/// A ray is a stright line in space define by a start point and a direction vector.
	/// The length of the direction vector represents the length of the ray. When you call a
	/// Raycast object's execute() method it will iterate over each voxel which lies on the ray,
	/// starting from the defined start point. It will examine each voxel and terminate
	/// either when it encounters a solid voxel or when it reaches the end of the ray. If a
	/// solid voxel is encountered then its position is stored in the intersectionVoxel field
	/// of the RaycastResult structure and the intersectionFound flag is set to true, otherwise
	/// the intersectionFound flag is set to false.
	///
	/// The following code snippet shows how the class is used:
	/// \code
	/// Vector3DFloat start(rayOrigin.x(), rayOrigin.y(), rayOrigin.z());
	/// Vector3DFloat direction(rayDir.x(), rayDir.y(), rayDir.z());
	/// direction.normalise();
	/// direction *= 1000.0f; //Casts ray of length 1000
	/// 
	/// RaycastResult raycastResult;
	/// Raycast<Material8> raycast(m_pPolyVoxVolume, start, direction, raycastResult);
	/// raycast.execute();
	/// 
	/// if(raycastResult.foundIntersection)
	/// {
	/// 	//...
	/// }
	/// \endcode
	///
	/// Some further notes, the Raycast uses full 26-connectivity, which basically means it 
	/// will examine every voxel the ray touches, even if it just passes through the corner.
	/// Also, it peforms a simple binary test against a voxel's threshold, rather than making
	/// use of it's density. Therefore it will work best in conjunction with one of the 'cubic'
	/// surace extractors. It's behaviour with the Marching Cubes surface extractor has not
	/// been tested yet.
