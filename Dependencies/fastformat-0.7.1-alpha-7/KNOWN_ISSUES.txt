FastFormat - Known Issues

FastFormat 0.7 Known Issues:
----------------------------

 * docs are incomplete

 * website is incomplete (actually it's rubbish - but not for long, hopefully!)

 * there's an apparent defect in the template interpretation mechanisms of
   Borland (pre 6.0/6.1) and
   Digital Mars' C++ compilers, which basically prohibits their
   being used with type filtering (the filter_type action shims). To handle
   this the symbol FASTFORMAT_NO_FILTER_TYPE_CONVERSION_SHIM_SUPPORT is
   defined in fastformat/fastformat.hpp for these compilers (and for Watcom,
   which is not yet supported), and used in the application layer function
   templates (and certain example and test programs in the distro).
