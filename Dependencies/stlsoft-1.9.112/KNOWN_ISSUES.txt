STLSoft 1.9 Known Issues:
-------------------------

 * The "safe string" library compatibility is not done yet. This is planned
   to be fully complete with 1.10.

 * There are some problems with GCC 4+ in compiling the fixed array classes
   with the subscript operators.

 * The GCC atomic integer APIs are not yet used. This is planned for the
   future.

 * The documentation is still hopeless. This will be addressed in the
   release of 1.10.

 * Several unixstl::system_traits methods are declared but not defined, with
   the intention to flesh them out from Linux system calls (and have
   emulations/workarounds for other architectures)

STLSoft 1.9 Suspected Issues:
-----------------------------

 * The SunPro C/C++ has not been fully tested, and remains speculative for
   the moment
