There are several ways in which you can help the STLSoft project:

 1. Defect reports
 2. Feature requests
 3. Volunteer your help
 4. Sponsor development
 5. Write articles, blog-posts about your experiences
 6. Help flesh out the Wikipedia page for STLSoft


1. Defect reports
-----------------

We're very keen to hear of any problems you have in using the libraries.

If you're unsure whether your issue is a genuine defect in the library, we
ask that you post a description of your problem on the project Help Forum,
located at:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/stlsoft/forums/forum/864084

If you're sure that your issue is a genuine defect, please feel free to
submit an item in the project Bug Tracker, located at:

  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=238860&atid=1107746

In either case, please help us to help you by submitting as much information
about the problem as you think is relevant, including:

 * the compiler you're using
 * the architecture and operating system you're targeting
 * the version of STLSoft
 * the version of other 3rd-party libraries, such as Boost, Loki, ...
 * whether you're building using the makefiles or via an IDE
 * a section of the build output, including the warnings/errors involved


2. Feature requests
-------------------

If there are features that you think would enhance the libraries, please
feel free to share your ideas.

If you're precisely sure what you need, please feel free to start a
conversation on the Open Discussion Forum, located at:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/stlsoft/forums/forum/864083

If you're clear of what you need, please feel free to submit an item in the
project Feature Request Tracker, located at:

  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=238860&atid=1107749


3. Volunteer your help
----------------------

If you have any components you'd like to submit to the libraries, or you
would like to offer any other help, please get in contact.

In particular, at the moment we're hoping to move to redevelop the STLSoft
website using MediaWiki (on SourceForge) and we'd be very keen to hear
from anyone who has skills in this area (as we don't!)

If you wish to help out in any way, please get in contact at via the Open
Discussion Forum, located at:
