  <h1>Pantheios - Project Map - examples</h1>

  <p>
  The example programs are contained in the sub-directories of this directory.
  </p>

  <p>
  The examples are divided into C and C++, in the subdirectories <code>c</code>
  and <code>cpp</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
  All example files are compiled and linked, ready for execution, as part of
  the build process (see <a href="../build/readme.html">../build/readme.html</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
  All example files are built into the auto-generated documentation, and their
  contents are best viewed in that form, where the Pantheios library components
  that they make use of may be browsed directly.
