Hi,

[u][Scroll down to check out the screenshots and skip the blabla[/u]]

This is a world editor I've been working on for a few months now. I took a long break, but recently started working on it again, as I currently have more free time.
Its main goal is to be very intuitive and easy to use. Eventually, I'll be using it to work on a small game (probly RPGish).
